Each code session comes with a series of exercises. In this folder you can find all the material. Tasks (named after each session `S-0sessionNumber` and after each exercise `Task-number`).

Base template and demo:

* `00-Template` contains the empty template you can use to build your scrollytelling websites!
* `00-Demo` contains a demo of our template, you can use it to see some action.

## Session 1 - How does our template work?
`S01-Intro` is the clean template we will use in session 1

* `S01-Task-1` - Add a block of text in the scrolling session and change its content, position and change the title color.
* `S01-Task-2` - Add a new circle in the middle of the figure when the `step >= 2`
* `S01-Task-3`- When the step is equal or greater than the block of text you create in Task 1, substitute the svg with an image of your choice, the image has to be centered on the screen.
